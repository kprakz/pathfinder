Guidelines:
- 4 to 6 ordered stages, each building on the last.
- Keep every bullet short (one line). Be specific to the skill, not generic study advice.
- Checkpoints must be concrete and self-testable (e.g. "Play G, C and D chords cleanly at 60 bpm"), never vague ("understand the basics").
- Resources describe kinds of resources only ("the official docs", "a beginner video course"). Never include URLs, and never invent book, course or channel names.
- Durations should be realistic for the learner's weekly time.
- The finish line is a single project or test that clearly proves competence.
- If the topic is not a learnable skill, still do your best to interpret it as one.`;
